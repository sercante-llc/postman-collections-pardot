You can also download the collection and environment files from this repo, then import directly into Postman.

### Prerequisites

- *Postman* The collection is for use by the Postman app. Postman is a utility that allows you to quickly test and use REST APIs. More information can be found at [getpostman.com](https://www.getpostman.com/).
- *Pardot* To use Pardot's API, you must have access to Pardot with permissions enabled for which resource you want to use.

## Usage

The collection is arranged in folders according to the API endpoints.

Almost all requests require a valid user credentials.  The collection requests have headers setup for this.
This should be set in your [Postman environment](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments) i.e. outside the collection itself. This should help avoid accidental commits of API keys to repos.
